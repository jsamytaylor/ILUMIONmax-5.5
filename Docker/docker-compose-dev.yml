# This docker-compose-dev.yml file is suited for developers wishing to
# build or develop FPP without using the docker container image on
# dockerhub.  docker-compose-dev.yml is run directly from the cloned
# fpp source.  To use the pre-built image, use docker-compose.yml and
# read the notes included at the top of that file for setup.

# The `context` and 'volumes' directives are relative to THIS directory, while
# the `dockerfile` directive is relative to the `context` directory.  For best
# results, run the `docker-compose` command in the fpp/ root directory.
#
# Additionally, you should NOT have a node_modules folder under www/ as the
# node_nodules binaries need to be from the container.
#
# fpp> docker-compose -f Docker/docker-compose-dev.yml up
