<p><b>Always transmit channel data</b> - Force transmission of channel data out to controllers whenever FPP is running.  FPP will normally only transmit data when there is a sequence playing or the system is running in Bridge mode or a Pixel Overlay model is enabled.  Some controllers go into test mode when not receiving data.  This setting causes FPP to always send data so the controllers do not go into test mode.</p>
