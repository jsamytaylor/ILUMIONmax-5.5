<h3>Memory Mapped Channel Block Field Descriptions</h3>

<p>The first three fields are required for all memory mapped channel blocks defined.</p>

<p><b>Block Name</b> - This is a unique named identifier to refer to the block, such as "Matrix #1" or "Left Mega-Tree".  This name will be used in the UI and command line utilities to refer to the block.</p>

<p><b>Start Ch.</b> - The starting channel of the block.  This is the lowest channel used in the matrix or tree.  It is required that the block be made up of a contiguous group of channels, gaps in channel numbers between strings are not allowed.  If the first pixel is on channels 1-3 then you would put 1 in this field.  If your first pixel is on channels 513-515 then you would put 513 in this field.</p>

<p><b>Ch. Count</b> - The total number of channels in the block.  This field is not called "pixel count" because the memory mapped channel block functionality is not restricted to pixels.  If your matrix is 10 pixels wide by 10 pixels tall, that is a total of 100 pixels so the "Ch. Count" field would be 300 since each pixel takes up 3 channels for the R, G, B elements.</p>

<p>The rest of the options are currently for use for matrices and pixel trees, but it is still required to fill them in.  The defaults of 'Horizontal', 'Top Left', 1, 1 are sufficient.</p>

<p>Matrix/Pixel-Tree Options:</p>

<p><b>Orientation</b> - The directionality of the individual strings in your display item.  If you have a pixel tree, then your strings probably run vertically.  If you have a matrix, your strings could run vertically or horizontally.  If you are building a new matrix and don't have a preference and want to use the memory mapped block feature of FPP to do innovative things with your display, build it using a horizontal layout because it's more optimal for the code in FPP that deals with the data in memory.  This leaves more CPU available for other things.</p>

<p><b>Start Corner</b> - This is where the first pixel is located in your matrix or tree.  If your matrix starts on the top left and zig-zags down to the bottom, then you'd select "Top Left" here.  If you have a pixel tree that starts at the bottom and strings are folded to the right so that the second string is to the right of the first string, then you would select "Bottom Left".  If that tree wrapped to the left as the channel counts go up, then you'd select Bottom Right"</p>

<p><b>Strings</b> - This is the total number of strings in the display item.  Strings must begin at the end of a row (horizontal orientation) or a column (vertical orientation).  If you have a 32-wide by 16-tall matrix with each line being an individual string, then you would put 16 in this field.  If you folded 8 strings of 64 pixels each to make that same 32x16 matrix, then you would put 8 in this field because there are only 8 strings.</p>

<p><b>Strands</b> - This column is actually the "number of strands per string".  This is the number of rows (horizontal orientation) or columns (vertical orientation) that a single string takes up in your display.  If you fold your strings in half, then this number would be 2.  If a single strings wraps so that it fills up 5 lines of your horizontal matrix, this value would be 5.</p>
