<h3>Real-Time Pixel Overlay Models</h3>

<p>The <b>Real-Time Pixel Overlay</b> feature of the Falcon Player allows the user to manipulate channel data in real-time before it is sent out to the controllers.  This can be done while the rest of your display and channels are playing sequenced data from a .fseq sequence file.  The Pixel Overlay Models can be turned on and off independently of each other and may be used when sequence data is playing or not playing.  When a Pixel Overlay Model is enabled, the data input via the Pixel Overlay feature overrides channel data in the sequence file allowing you to take control of a portion of your display real-time.  This can be used for examples such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Displaying real-time dynamic text on a matrix or pixel tree</li>
<li>Displaying the current time or a Christmas countdown timer on a matrix</li>
<li>Turning on/off individual channels for items such as a Tune-To sign, or inflatables without having to sequence the channels for these items in every one of your sequence files.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <b>Matrix Tools</b> plugin available via the Plugin install page uses the Pixel Overlay feature to allow display and scrolling of dynamic text on a Pixel Overlay Model using a web interface.  As an example of the power and flexibility of the Real-Time Pixel Overlay feature, you can also use the Matrix Tools plugin to draw in Real-Time on your matrix using your mouse and web browser.  Future Matrix Tools support will include the ability to display live video being captured from a webcam attached to the Falcon Player.</p>
